//when you explore the first time:
console.log("You decide to leave the dark room. An equally dark hallway awaits, the rats are still noisy. Maybe there are more doors to be seen.")

//let them read for a bit. maybe after like five reads:
console.log("The walls are deafeningly loud. Yet you swear there was a whisper just now.")
//let them open a room (7 knowledge):
console.log("Another room full of books. Just as dark and just as loud as the last one.")

//maybe collect like 10 knowledge:

//when you talk to him once
console.log("The man whispers to you. He talks of secrets and worlds long gone. The knowledge he shares is of remarkable use.")
//now you can afford upgrades.
//first upgrade is understanding, doubles knowledge from books.
console.log("The man asks you to give him knowledge for understanding. You do not know what he means but accept. Somehow the symbols make far more sense now.")
//talk to him one more time.
console.log("The man whispers of a gate, a key and a guard. He says they will guide you if you give them space.")
//Upgrade for oracle which costs rooms.
//when you take the upgrade:
console.log("You tell the man that you will give them room. You do not know what it means, but the doors are no longer. Instead there is a gate.")
//when first speaking to the gate:
console.log("The gate is dark and endless as eternity. You do not dare to enter nor stare inside. But there is sound, less a voice then a maddening lullaby.")
//when you speak to the gate a second time:
console.log("The gate tells you of something that sleeps beneath the floors. You will have to explore more to find what you seek.")
//if you have enough rooms but dont buy the upgrade:
console.log("The gates song as stopped, there is silence. Only the wind speaks of the power the man has given you")
//when you buy the grotto upgrade:

//goal is to reach 100 rooms. if they do:
console.log("You found the main hall. You look up to count the floors you have yet to explore. But as you start to count the floors move. You accept the infinitude of the library and start to search for the main entrance.")
//goal is now to reach 200 rooms. if they do:
console.log("You open the big iron doors, more resembling the doors of a bunker then a library. The outside world is bright and far. You feel dizzy and go back to your books.")
//asking the gate what to do:
console.log("The gate sings of all kind of things to be found under the sun. You feel you want to send someone out there. Maybe with more knowledge you may find someone.")

//asking the gate what to do:
console.log("The songs turn mournful and deep. The gate sings of a son it lost. A song of how relics where used to banish him.")
//asking nya what to do:
console.log("The man whispers of old times. Whispers of times when creatures not unlike the man, in appearance, ruled the world. A time when they sealed a lurking fear.")

console.log("A man bearing flames of destruction came to you. He sat your library a flame. You notice that the library seams to rebuild faster then it burns. However, the flame keeps you and your inhabitants quiet distracted.")

console.log("The gate hums happily. It is a hum of awakening, of reincarnation and progress. You feel that with more relics you could help the reincarnation.")
console.log("The whispers have become quiet, so very quiet. Silently the whisper tells of rituals and waking. The words relics seam to be strewn about.")

//after buying the war interface(World Tab):
//nya and gate:
console.log("The lullaby sings of flutes. Flutes playing loudly, playing aggressively. Are they declaring war? War they shall have.")
console.log("The man murmurs. Murmurs of change. Murmurs of sleep and the flutes playing a sleepy song. Murmurs of how the flutes must be muted.")
//after beating/taking the first town:
console.log("You dream. Dream of flutes and drums. Of flutes and drums from nowhere. Singing to nothing and all. Their maddening song reaching you all the way here.")
//nya and gate:
console.log("The same song as before. A lullaby of flutes. They play loud, play aggressive, play without your consent. War. War is your answer.")
console.log("The man tells you of a time long gone. A time when many of those giant things lived. When non of your enemies lived and all that was was your kind.")
//after taking the first mayor city.
console.log("You found a scroll. A ritual. A ritual old as time. One that will bring you closer to the flutes.")
//using and beating the summon:
console.log("Silence. Silence so comfortable. The first Flute is muted. And soon all others will too.")
//talking to nya and gate:
console.log("The gate hums an onomous tune. It hums about his lost son. About the failed assignment. And a son that is not its own.")
console.log("There is silence. Even the whispers have silenced. Silence for so long. 'Good Job' the whispers say, once, not more.")
//if you talk to nya again:
console.log("There is silence. The joyous man stands still and silent. You notice that he feels less like a stranger now. More like family.")
//second ritual done:
console.log("The flute has stopped. Silence sweeps the land. Nothing makes a sound anymore. As you stand in the silence you dream. Dream of awakening.")
//talking to nya and gate:
console.log("The songs become more calming then they used to be. The song is about sleep, about awakening and dreams. Dreaming for so long.")
console.log("Whispers swirl around your head. The whispers tell of birth and creation. Of dreams and creations as one.")
//third ritual:
console.log("The world has turned quiet. The drums of war playing in the far distance. No more birds, no more wildlife. All is quiet.")
//talking to nya and gate:
console.log("A chant from eons ago echos through the gate. The chant tells of a time before sound. When all was silence, and how this time may come again.")
console.log("The man seams different. Sad maybe? No, sad is not a possibility. But different. He talk of a time when he supported mankind. A time when he was bored.")
//fourth ritual:
console.log("For a minute it seams as though the entire earth halted. No sound was heard, no movement made.")
//talking to nya and gate:
console.log("The Gate chants. It chants from a time long gone and soon to be. A time of change. A time before the flutes. A time when all was and nothing remaind.")
console.log("The joyous man laughs into his whispers. The whispers change and contradict. Talk of creation and boredom. Talk of help and wait. Talk of masters sleep and dream.")
//fifth ritual:
console.log("Silence on the world. No bird, no man, no wind will howl. As the world stood still you hear a sound. One last flute. Far off from where you ever gone.")
//talking to nya and gate:
console.log("A sonata reaches your mind. It hums of long dreams. Of a creature sleeping in the middle of it all. And of the silence that will awake it.")
